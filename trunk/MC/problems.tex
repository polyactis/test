\section{problems of Chapter 2}
\subsection{problem 2.1}

\begin{math}
\int_{0}^{1} sin^2(1/x)dx = \int_{0}^{1}1/2(cos(0)-cos(2/x))dx = \int_{0}^{1}1/2(1-cos(2/x))dx = 1/2 - 1/2\int_{0}^{1}cos(2/x)dx
\end{math}

I don't know how to solve $\int_{0}^{1}cos(2/x)dx$. Several results returned by google search are not satisfactory. Instead, i use mathematica(matlab is down for some reason on hpc-cmb), $NIntegrate[Sin[1/x]*Sin[1/x], \{x, 0, 1\}]$ to get 0.673427 and regard this as the deterministic answer though mathematica fails to converge.

SimulateIntegral.py uses the plain Monte carlo method. $1e^4$ samplings gives mean: 0.673037731012, and std: 0.00282346219155 and $1e^7$ samplings outputs a much more accurate answer with a smaller std: 0.673477836344 (7.40591084413e-05) .

\subsection{problem 2.2}
The only trouble is how to get the analytic form of $t_v(x; \mu, \Sigma)$ to carry out the differentiation.
